# Debugging Diary - Nova AI Memory MCP Server Tests

**Date:** 2025-04-20

**Goal:** Run integration tests for core services (Embedding, Pinecone, Graph).

**Summary:**

1.  **Initial Context:** Read project documentation (RESEARCH, PLANNING, ARCHITECTURE, TASK) to understand the setup. Confirmed all implementation tasks in `TASK.md` were marked complete.
2.  **Target:** Execute tests in the `/tests` directory, starting with `test_embedding_service.py`.

**`tests/test_embedding_service.py`:**

*   **Attempt 1:** Ran `python tests/test_embedding_service.py`.
    *   **Error:** `ImportError: No module named 'pydantic_settings'`.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Missing dependency required by `app/config.py`.
    *   **Fix 1:** Added `pydantic-settings==0.3.0` to `requirements.txt`.
*   **Attempt 2:** Ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   **Error:** `ERROR: No matching distribution found for pydantic-settings==0.3.0`.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Specified version `0.3.0` does not exist on PyPI.
    *   **Fix 2:** Updated `requirements.txt` to use latest available version `pydantic-settings==2.9.1`.
*   **Attempt 3:** Ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   **Error:** File corruption/encoding issue in `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Fix 3:** Rewrote `requirements.txt` with correct content and encoding.
*   **Attempt 4:** Ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   **Result:** Successfully installed `pydantic-settings`.
*   **Attempt 5:** Ran `python tests/test_embedding_service.py`.
    *   **Error:** `ValidationError: 1 validation error for Settings PINECONE_ENV Field required`.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Configuration loading failed because required environment variables were not set.
    *   **Fix 4:** Created `.env` file with necessary variables (using placeholder values initially, then confirmed user had correct values).
*   **Attempt 6:** Ran `python tests/test_embedding_service.py`.
    *   **Result:** ✅ All tests passed.
    *   **Action:** Updated `TASK.md` for Task T6.

**`tests/test_pinecone_client_integration.py`:**

*   **Attempt 1:** Ran `python tests/test_pinecone_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Error:** `Exception: The official Pinecone python package has been renamed...`.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Using deprecated `pinecone-client` package instead of the new `pinecone` package.
    *   **Fix 5:** Updated `requirements.txt` to replace `pinecone-client==6.0.0` with `pinecone==4.1.0`. Rewrote file due to persistent formatting issues.
*   **Attempt 2:** Ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   **Result:** Successfully uninstalled `pinecone-client` and installed `pinecone`.
*   **Attempt 3:** Ran `python tests/test_pinecone_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Error:** `TypeError: argument of type 'method' is not iterable` in `pc.list_indexes().names`.
    *   **Diagnosis:** API change in `pinecone` v4.x for listing indexes.
    *   **Fix 6:** Updated index listing logic in `app/services/pinecone_client.py` to use `[index.name for index in pc.list_indexes().indexes]`.
*   **Attempt 4:** Ran `python tests/test_pinecone_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Error:** Test 4 (Query) failed - upserted vector not found immediately after upsert.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Potential Pinecone indexing delay.
    *   **Fix 7:** Increased `asyncio.sleep()` duration after upsert in the test script from 3 to 10 seconds.
*   **Attempt 5:** Ran `python tests/test_pinecone_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Result:** ✅ All tests passed.
    *   **Action:** Updated `TASK.md` for Task T7.

**`tests/test_graph_client_integration.py`:**

*   **Attempt 1 (Host):** Ran `python tests/test_graph_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Error:** `ValueError: Cannot resolve address neo4j:7687`.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Script running on host trying to use Docker service name `neo4j`. `NEO4J_URI` in `.env` or environment variable likely set incorrectly for host execution.
    *   **Fix 8:** Explicitly set `NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687` in `.env`.
*   **Attempt 2 (Host):** Ran `python tests/test_graph_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Error:** `ValueError: Cannot resolve address neo4j:7687` (persisted).
    *   **Diagnosis:** System environment variable `NEO4J_URI` likely overriding `.env` file.
    *   **Fix 9:** User confirmed environment variable was unset/removed.
*   **Attempt 3 (Host):** Ran `python tests/test_graph_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Error:** `neo4j.exceptions.AuthError: {code: Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized}`.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Correct URI (`bolt://localhost:7687`) used, but authentication failed with credentials from `.env` (`neo4j`/`test12345`). User confirmed credentials work via Neo4j Browser.
    *   **Fix 10:** Rewrote `.env` file to ensure no hidden characters in password.
*   **Attempt 4 (Host):** Ran `python tests/test_graph_client_integration.py`.
    *   **Error:** `neo4j.exceptions.AuthError: {code: Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized}` (persisted).
    *   **Diagnosis:** Authentication still failing despite correct URI and confirmed credentials. Issue might be subtle config loading or driver interaction problem.
*   **Attempt 5 (Docker):** Switched strategy to run test inside Docker container.
    *   **Fix 11:** Reverted `NEO4J_URI` in `.env` to `neo4j://neo4j:7687`.
    *   **Fix 12:** Corrected `requirements.txt` to use CPU-only PyTorch (`torch==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`) to address user performance concerns during build. Rewrote file due to formatting issues.
    *   **Fix 13:** Removed conflicting `neo4j_db` container (`docker stop/rm`).
    *   **Attempt 5.1:** Ran `docker-compose up -d --build`.
        *   **Error:** `dependency failed to start: container neo4j_db is unhealthy`. Neo4j container logs showed normal startup but health check failed.
        *   **Diagnosis:** Health check command (`wget` or `curl`) likely missing in Neo4j image or timing out.
        *   **Fix 14:** Removed `healthcheck` section from `neo4j` service in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   **Attempt 5.2:** Ran `docker-compose up -d`.
        *   **Result:** Containers started successfully.
    *   **Next Step:** Was about to run `docker-compose exec mcp-server python tests/test_graph_client_integration.py` but was interrupted.

**Current Status:**

*   `test_embedding_service.py`: ✅ Passed.
*   `test_pinecone_client_integration.py`: ✅ Passed.
*   `test_graph_client_integration.py`: ❌ Blocked. Last attempt was to run inside Docker after fixing Dockerfile/Compose issues, but was interrupted before execution. The previous attempts running directly on the host failed due to an unresolved `AuthError` despite confirmed credentials.
*   Docker environment is configured to run both services (`mcp-server`, `neo4j`) with the correct internal URI (`neo4j://neo4j:7687`) and CPU-only PyTorch.

**Next Agent Recommendation:**

1.  Attempt to run the Neo4j integration test inside the Docker container: `docker-compose exec mcp-server python tests/test_graph_client_integration.py`.
2.  If it passes, update `TASK.md` for T8.
3.  If it fails (e.g., with the same `AuthError`), the authentication issue needs deeper investigation (perhaps driver version compatibility, specific Neo4j configuration, or subtle credential handling bug). Consider skipping T8 integration tests temporarily if it remains blocked.
4.  Proceed to examine and run `tests/test_memory_service.py` and `tests/test_api_endpoints.py`.
## Debugging Session: Server Initialization Failure (Date: 2025-04-21)

**Initial Problem:**
- Server started via `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`.
- Health check (`/memory/health`) returned 503 error: `{"detail":"Memory service is not ready. Initialization may have failed."}`.
- Initial Uvicorn logs showed: `--- Application Resources Initialized (Placeholders) ---`.

**Investigation & Fixes:**

1.  **Issue:** `app/main.py`'s `lifespan` function wasn't calling the actual `MemoryService.initialize()` method needed for connecting to dependencies (Pinecone, Neo4j, etc.).
    *   **Action:** Modified `app/main.py` to import the shared `memory_service_instance` from `app/api/memory_routes.py` and added `await memory_service_instance.initialize()` to the `lifespan` startup phase.

2.  **Issue:** After the first fix, server failed on restart with `TypeError: An asyncio.Future, a coroutine or an awaitable is required` inside `MemoryService.initialize` when calling `asyncio.gather`.
    *   **Analysis:** Traced the error to the `init_tasks` dictionary. Suspected one of the initialization calls was synchronous.
    *   **Verification:** Checked `app/services/pinecone_client.py` and confirmed `PineconeClient.initialize` was defined as `def` (synchronous), not `async def`.
    *   **Action:** Modified `app/services/memory_service.py` to wrap the synchronous `self.pinecone_client.initialize` call using `asyncio.to_thread()` within the `init_tasks` dictionary.

3.  **Issue:** After the second fix, server restarted but failed again during startup.
    *   **Error Log:** `ValueError: Cannot resolve address neo4j:7687` and `socket.gaierror: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`.
    *   **Analysis:** This indicates the application cannot find the Neo4j database at the hostname `neo4j`. This is likely a configuration issue related to the Neo4j connection URI or a networking problem (e.g., the Neo4j container isn't running or isn't accessible by that name).

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the Neo4j connection configuration (`NEO4J_URI` in `.env`) and ensure the Neo4j service/container is running and accessible.

**Continuation (2025-04-21):**

4.  **Issue:** Despite `.env` being set to `localhost`, Uvicorn logs still showed attempts to connect to `neo4j:7687`. Added a debug print to `app/config.py` which confirmed `bolt://neo4j:7687` was being loaded. Suspected environment variable override or issue with Uvicorn reload inheriting variables.
    *   **Action:** Removed debug print. Checked terminal environment variable (`Get-ChildItem Env:NEO4J_URI`), which correctly showed `localhost`.
    *   **Action:** Attempted to explicitly set the variable for the Uvicorn process: `$env:NEO4J_URI='bolt://localhost:7687'; uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`.

5.  **Issue:** Uvicorn process became unresponsive to `Ctrl+C`.
    *   **Action:** Instructed user to close unresponsive terminal and open a new one.

6.  **Issue:** User ran Uvicorn from the wrong directory, causing `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`.
    *   **Action:** Instructed user to `cd` to the project directory first.

7.  **Issue:** Attempted to chain `cd` and `uvicorn` using `&&` (incorrect for PowerShell).
    *   **Action:** Corrected command to use `;` as separator: `cd ... ; $env:NEO4J_URI=... ; uvicorn ...`.

8.  **Issue:** Server failed to start with `[winerror 10048] only one usage of each socket address... is normally permitted` on port 8000, indicating the port was still in use by a previous process.
    *   **Action:** Instructed user to close all old Uvicorn terminals.
    *   **Action:** Modified the Uvicorn command to use port 8001 and removed `--reload`: `$env:NEO4J_URI='bolt://localhost:7687'; uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001`.

9.  **Success:** Server started successfully on port 8001.
    *   **Verification:** Ran health check `Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8001/memory/health`.
    *   **Result:** Health check returned `status: ok, pinecone: ok, graph: ok, reranker: loaded`.

**Resolution:** Server is now running correctly on port 8001 after addressing initialization logic, async/sync calls, environment variable precedence, and port conflicts.

## Debugging Session: Server Startup &amp; Query Errors (Date: 2025-04-26)

**Goal:** Start the MCP server using Docker Compose and test basic functionality.

**Initial Problem:**
- Started services using `docker-compose up`.
- Health check (`/memory/health` on port 8001 initially, then corrected to 8000 based on `docker-compose.yml`) returned 503 error: `{"detail":"Memory service is not ready. Initialization may have failed."}`.
- Server logs showed `MemoryService accessed before initialization!`.

**Investigation &amp; Fixes:**

1.  **Issue:** `MemoryService.initialize` in `app/services/memory_service.py` incorrectly set `self._initialized = True` even if Pinecone or Graph client initialization failed.
    *   **Action:** Modified `MemoryService.initialize` to only set `self._initialized = True` if both `pinecone_ok` and `graph_ok` are true.

2.  **Issue:** After Fix 1 and restarting (`docker-compose down`, `docker-compose up --build mcp-server`), server failed during startup with `neo4j.exceptions.ServiceUnavailable: Couldn't connect to localhost:7687`.
    *   **Analysis:** The server container was using `localhost` for the Neo4j URI, which is incorrect within the Docker network. It should use the service name `neo4j`.
    *   **Action:** Corrected `NEO4J_URI` in `.env` file from `bolt://localhost:7687` to `bolt://neo4j:7687`.

3.  **Issue:** After Fix 2 and restarting, the server started, and the health check passed. However, a test (`upsert` followed by `query`) failed. The query (`Invoke-RestMethod ... /memory/query`) returned empty results (`{}`), and server logs showed `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` during `asyncio.gather` in `MemoryService.perform_query`.
    *   **Analysis:** `asyncio.gather` was attempting to await a synchronous function (`pinecone_client.query_vector`) alongside an asynchronous one (`graph_client.query_graph`).
    *   **Action:** Modified `MemoryService.perform_query` to wrap the synchronous `self.pinecone_client.query_vector` call in `asyncio.to_thread()` within the `asyncio.gather`.

4.  **Issue:** After Fix 3 and restarting, the query test failed with a 500 Internal Server Error. Server logs showed `pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation error for MemoryItem score Field required`.
    *   **Analysis:** The data structure returned by the service pipeline (containing `rerank_score` or `fusion_score`) did not directly match the `MemoryItem` Pydantic model used in the API response, which expected a field named `score`.
    *   **Action:** Modified the query endpoint in `app/api/memory_routes.py` to explicitly map the fields from the result dictionary to the `MemoryItem` model, checking for `rerank_score` or `fusion_score` and assigning it to the `score` field.

**Final Result:**
- After applying Fix 4 and restarting (`docker-compose down`, `docker-compose up --build mcp-server`), the server started successfully.
- The health check passed.
- The `upsert` test (`Invoke-RestMethod ... /memory/upsert`) succeeded.
- The `query` test (`Invoke-RestMethod ... /memory/query`) succeeded, returning the previously upserted item with the correct structure.

**Resolution:** The server is now running correctly via Docker Compose, and basic upsert/query functionality is verified after addressing multiple issues related to initialization logic, configuration, asynchronous programming, and data model mapping.
